What are Signal

 

Signal is a software interrupt /event generated by the UNIX and LINUX system in response to some condition. 
Upon receipt a process may take some action. 
Signals are raised in   
Error condition(memory segment,floatimg point,illegal instructions) 
They are generated by shell and terminal handlers to cause interrupts. 
Signals are defined in header file signal.h.  (/linux-5.18.10/include/linux)

What is signal Handling

A Signal may be handled by following one of two possible handlers −

A default signal handler
A user-defined signal handler
A default signal handler is associated with every signal that the kernel runs when handling that signal.
User-defined signal handler can override this default action that is called to handle the signal.
